# ðŸ’¬ Chat Room
This is an end-to-end demo of the Aptos Event Stream. It includes a simple smart contract and frontend for a fully on-chain chat room. 

Using only a WebSocket connection to the Event Stream, we are able to achieve a latency of 0.2 - 0.8 seconds between transaction timestamp and the corresponding event (chat message, reaction, join/leave) being reflected on the frontend.
